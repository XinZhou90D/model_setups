# Log for file transfer to BOM_0125_proto
## Restart files and config files
`archive` copied from /lustre/f2/scratch/gfdl/oar.gfdl.ogrp-account/work/CMIP6/OMIP/xanadu_mom6_20181101/OM4p125_IAF_csf_JRA55do1-3_r5_cycle4.o348634/output.stager/lustre/f2/scratch/oar.gfdl.ogrp-account/CMIP6/OMIP/xanadu_mom6_20181101/OM4p125_IAF_csf_JRA55do1-3_r5_cycle4/ncrc4.intel16f2-prod

This was the physics only run for the OMIP6 experiment, which I will use as a base for the BOM_0125 prototype.

Further steps: 

I removed the earlier year and all output with: 
rm -r ./archive/restart/20010101 ./archive/history/20000101.nc ./archive/ascii/20000101.ascii_out ./archive/history

## Grid files
`input_files/grid/tripolar_disp_res8_grid_data.tar` is copied from /archive/Niki.Zadeh/input/xanadu/OM4p125_grid/tripolar_disp_res8_grid_data.tar in accordance to the xml file in `archive/restart/OMIP4_JRA_r5.xml`.

Additionally the tidal amplitude file in `input/files/tidal_amplitude.v20181107.nc` was copied from gaea `/lustre/f2/dev/Niki.Zadeh/archive/input/xanadu/OM4p125_grid/tidal_amplitude.v20181107.nc`
## more Grid files
Niki has created some mask tables in /lustre/f2/dev/Niki.Zadeh/archive/input/xanadu/OM4p125_grid. I will use the mask tables from there, but keep the above grid files until the updated 1/8 is released (e.g. Black Sea is added). The files are copied to `OM4p_125/updates/input_files/grid`

## Issue with missing icebergs
The above files are missing the restart information for icebergs. I have copied the restart files again into `archive_alternative_with_icebergs` from gaea `/lustre/f2/scratch/gfdl/oar.gfdl.ogrp-account/work/CMIP6/OMIP/xanadu_mom6_20181101/OM4p125_IAF_csf_JRA55do1-3_r5_cycle4.o348634/RESTART`.


## TODO
- Check the alternative files for consistency with the old ones...
- write a script that copies folders automatically (how do I do this on gaea?)
- Move the `xanadu...` folder to `OM4p_125` as subfolder
